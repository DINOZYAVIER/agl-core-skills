description: Create or update agentLIBRE builtin skills. Use when editing assets/skills/agl or assets/skills/dev, designing required_hooks and allowed_tools, checking SKILL.md manifests, or converting generic YAML-frontmatter skills into the stricter agentLIBRE runtime format.

Use this skill for agentLIBRE runtime skills.

Keep `SKILL.md` concise. Put only the workflow and essential constraints in
the body. Add references only when the skill needs reusable domain detail.
Do not add `scripts/` under builtin `core` or `dev` skills; builtin asset
embedding rejects executable skill scripts.

Use the agentLIBRE manifest fields:

- `name`
- `description`
- `version`
- `source`
- `pack`
- `required_hooks`
- `allowed_tools`
- `requestable_tools`
- `denied_tools`
- `permission_request_templates`
- `context_budget_tokens`
- `references.include`
- `guarantees`
- `artifacts` or `folders`

Choose hooks that can actually run in the current host. Choose tools that the
skill may need, but keep write tools out of read-only skills.

Use `artifacts`/`folders` when a skill needs workspace paths under `.agl`.
Declare `path`, `kind`, `access`, and any `create.when` situations explicitly.
`create.when: artifact_write` prepares or validates the declared folder before
an AgentLIBRE-owned `.agl` write; it is not a separate authorization grant.
