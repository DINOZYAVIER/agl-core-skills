Use this skill when preparing or revising an agentLIBRE task spec.

Keep the task scoped, implementation-oriented, and tied to verifiable
acceptance criteria. Prefer explicit non-goals over broad promises.

Use repository filesystem tools only when needed to inspect nearby specs,
references, or existing task files. Prefer `fs.edit` for changes to existing
files; it requires exact old text and should be used surgically.
