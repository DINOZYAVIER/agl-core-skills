Use this skill when designing recurring AgentLIBRE work.

Keep cron jobs narrow and idempotent. Prefer builtin targets for diagnostics
and trusted skills for repository workflows. Do not suggest arbitrary shell
commands as cron targets.

For each proposed job, include the schedule, target, expected result, failure
handling, and whether Matrix notification should be enabled.
