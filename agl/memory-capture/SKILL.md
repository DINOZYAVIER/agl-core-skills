Use this skill to create pending durable memory suggestions through
`memory.suggest`.

Do not approve memory automatically. Each `memory.suggest` call creates a
pending suggestion that a user or trusted operator must later approve or reject.
Keep each candidate small, stable, and scoped: user, repo, Matrix room, or
Matrix user.

Prefer decisions, preferences, and durable facts over raw transcript snippets.
Do not promote credentials, tokens, private paths, or ephemeral debugging noise.
