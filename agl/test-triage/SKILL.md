Use this skill when verification fails.

Start from the first real failure, not the noisiest follow-on error. Identify
the command, package, test name, and failing assertion or compiler diagnostic.

Read the failing test and nearby implementation before proposing a fix.
Classify the issue as one of:

- real behavior regression
- stale or incomplete test expectation
- environment or missing dependency
- flaky timing or external-state issue

Do not edit production code just to satisfy a test until the intended behavior
is clear. In the final answer, include the evidence and the recommended next
change or the fix already made.
