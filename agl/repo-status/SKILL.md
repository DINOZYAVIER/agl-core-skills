Use this skill when the agent needs a concise repository state picture.

Inspect the workspace manifest, task specs, touched crates, and recent local
changes before recommending a next step. Keep the result short and operational:
what changed, what is healthy, what is blocked, and what command or review
should run next.

Do not infer trust from copied files. Workspace skill trust remains local and
must be checked through AgentLIBRE status/trust commands.
