Use the repository review-pack workflow, not hand-written standalone HTML.

Prepare a review manifest that points at the target repository, branch, base,
and head. Build payload data from the manifest, render PR/file/diff/
implementation pages, update the index, then validate the generated pack.

When reviewing uncommitted work, use a temporary commit object only if needed
to feed the review pipeline. Do not move the user's branch or change the real
index unless explicitly asked.

In the final answer, include the `.agl/reviews/.../index.html` path and the
review validation result.
