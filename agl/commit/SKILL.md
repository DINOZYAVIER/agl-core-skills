Use this skill for commit messages and history hygiene.

Follow repository `AGENTS.md` first. LLM agents must not certify DCO or add
themselves as co-authors. Use `Assisted-by` with the actual assisting tool and
model version when an LLM or coding agent meaningfully helped create a patch.
`Assisted-by: Codex:gpt-5.5`, `Assisted-by: Opencode:MODEL_VERSION`, and
`Assisted-by: Claude-Code:MODEL_VERSION` are examples, not requirements. List
specialized tools only when they materially found, generated, transformed, or
validated the patch.

Keep subject lines imperative and scoped. Keep the body focused on why the
change exists and what behavior changed. Do not include test logs unless a
short verification line is enough.

For checkpoint work, treat signed tags as version boundaries and keep human
`Signed-off-by` trailers for human-owned checkpoint/version bump commits.
