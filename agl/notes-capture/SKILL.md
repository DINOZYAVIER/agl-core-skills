Use this skill to create explicit notes through `notes.add` when the user asks
to keep project context, handoffs, research summaries, or temporary workflow
state. Do not create a note silently; the note must be an intentional artifact
of the current task.

Notes are useful for handoffs, temporary analysis, longer research, and
project-specific context that may or may not become memory later. Keep note
bodies readable and organized enough that a future agent can use them without
reconstructing the whole conversation.

Use `notes.search` and `notes.show` to avoid duplicates before creating a note
when the topic is likely already recorded. Use `notes.link` when a created note
should reference a task, review, memory, Matrix room, or repository artifact.

When a note deserves long-term retrieval, suggest explicit promotion to memory
as a separate decision.
