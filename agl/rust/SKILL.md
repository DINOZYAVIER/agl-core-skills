Use this skill for Rust workspace changes.

Read the crate's public exports, nearby tests, and existing error style before
changing APIs. Keep root `lib.rs` files small when the crate already uses
modules, but preserve public re-exports that callers rely on.

Prefer targeted verification:

- run formatting after Rust edits
- run package tests for touched crates
- run workspace checks when public contracts, shared crates, or generated
  assets changed

Do not add dependencies until an existing crate or standard library approach is
insufficient. If a dependency is needed, explain why in the final answer.

In the final answer, include changed crates and exact verification.
