Use this skill for review-first repository work.

Start from the changed surface, then read the contracts and tests that define
expected behavior. Lead with concrete findings, ordered by severity. Include
file paths, symbols, commands, or observed output when they are the basis for a
finding.

Do not turn a review into a broad rewrite proposal. If no issue is found, say
that clearly and call out remaining test gaps or residual risk.
