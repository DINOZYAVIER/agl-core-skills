Use this skill for commit boundaries and messages.

Follow repository `AGENTS.md` before any generic convention. Keep commits
small enough to review and revert. Prefer one task or one independently useful
slice per commit, especially when a wave touches store, CLI, assets, and repo
workflow code.

Commit messages should state the task and behavior change. Do not include DCO
trailers unless a human certifies them.
