Use this skill for security-oriented patch review.

Scan for credentials, access tokens, private keys, local absolute paths,
session dumps, and generated directories. Treat placeholder values as allowed
only when they are clearly examples or tests.

Pay special attention to Matrix bridge state, environment examples, config
loading, logs, transcripts, review artifacts, and generated caches.

In the final answer, state what was scanned, what was found, and whether any
remaining risk needs human review.
