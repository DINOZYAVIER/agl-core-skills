Use this skill for practical feature smoke testing.

Pick the smallest realistic path that exercises the feature from the outside:
CLI command, daemon request, Matrix bridge flow, or persisted store state. Try
both a normal path and one failure or misuse case when the feature is safety
sensitive.

When a smoke test fails, preserve the first real failure and classify whether
it is a regression, stale expectation, environment issue, or incomplete feature.
